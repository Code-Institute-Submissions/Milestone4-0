### test.py file was used to create tests for the installation of python and python modules ##

## Test for python installation, version and the path ##
# import sys

# this line prints if python is installed correctly
# def greet(greetings_to):
  # greeting = 'Hello, {}'.format(greetings_to)
  # return greeting
 
# print(greet('World!'))

# this line will print out the current python path and the version of the python
#Â print(sys.executable)

## Test for running Flask in VSCode ##
# Functionalities to import from modules
import os                  # Imports operating system dependent functionality.
from flask import Flask    # Imports Flask class from flask module .

# Route Decorator
@app.route('/')            # URL handled by main() route handler.

    return "Welcome Flask!"

# If conditional statement is satisfied

                                                   # gets the IP Address from the operating system.
      port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)),# gets PORT we want to open, which in this case is set to 5000.
